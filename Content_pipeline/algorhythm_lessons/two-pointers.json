For example, index 2 in the following array has height 1. It can trap water because there are higher bars to the left and right of it.\n\nTo calculate the exact amount of water that can be trapped at index 2, we first take the minimum height of the highest bars to the left and right of it, which in this case is 4. We then subtract the height of the bar at index 2, which is 1,",
